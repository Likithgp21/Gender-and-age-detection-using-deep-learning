**Gender and Age Detection Using Deep Learning**
**Overview**
The Gender and Age Detection Using Deep Learning project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict the gender and age group of individuals from facial images. By using a pre-trained deep learning model, the system is able to classify facial features into age categories and gender, enabling real-time demographic analysis for applications in security, marketing, and user experience enhancement.
**Features**
1.	Facial Feature Extraction: Uses CNNs to extract key features from images to identify gender and age.
2.	Real-Time Prediction: Classifies gender (male/female) and age groups (child, adolescent, adult, senior) from real-time camera feeds or uploaded images.
3.	Pre-trained Model: The model is pre-trained on a large dataset, capable of making predictions with high accuracy.
4.	User-Friendly Interface: Simple UI to upload images for gender and age classification.
**Purpose**
1.	This project aims to provide an efficient solution for identifying and categorizing individuals based on their age and gender. The model can be applied in various domains, including:
2.	Security: Automated identification for surveillance.
3.	Marketing: Targeted advertising based on demographics.
4.	Personalization: Improving user experiences by adapting to user age and gender.
**Technical Stack**
**Deep Learning Framework:**
1.	TensorFlow and Keras for model development.
2.	OpenCV for image processing.
Python Libraries:
1.	NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation.
2.	Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization.
3.	Pre-trained Model: A CNN model trained on a large facial dataset, such as the UTKFace dataset, for classification of gender and age.
